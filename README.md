DISCLAIMER: I will only ever post mods on the Steam workshop(or in the case of Minecraft mods, CurseForge;
and in the case of something like Slime Rancher, Nexus Mods.)
if you need a non-workshop release then make an issue and I'll respond when I see it

Credits:
credit to Deathpits for being awesome and helping an idiot like me,
Vigaro for a simplified version,
and Slime_Cubed for making me both more and less confused than I already was
