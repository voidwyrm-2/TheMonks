DISCLAIMER: I will only ever post mods on the Steam workshop(or in the case of Minecraft mods, CurseForge;
and in the case of something like Slime Rancher, Nexus Mods.)
if you need a non-workshop release then @me on the Rain World discord in the [insert channel here].
I if see it and you use the magic word “please” I will give it to you(this is not sarcasm).

Vigaro for a simplified version,
and Slime_Cubed for making me both more and less confused than I already was
